<p><h2>gdnsd</h2></p>

<p class="lead">gdnsd is an Authoritative-only DNS server which does geographic (or other sorts of) balancing, redirection, weighting, and service-state-conscious failover at the DNS layer.</p>

<p>gdnsd is written in C using libev and pthreads with a focus on high performance, low latency service. It does not offer any form of caching or recursive service, and notably does not support DNSSEC.  There's a strong focus on making the code efficient, lean, and resilient.  The code has a decent regression testsuite with full branch coverage on the core packet parsing and generation code, and some scripted QA tools for e.g. valgrind validation, clang-analyzer, etc.</p>

<p>The geographically-aware features also support the emerging <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vandergaast-edns-client-subnet/">EDNS Client Subnet draft</a> for receiving more-precise network location information from intermediate shared caches.</p>
