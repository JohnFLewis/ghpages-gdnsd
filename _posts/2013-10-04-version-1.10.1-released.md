    1.10.1 - 2013-10-04
        Bugfixes:
          A faulty assert() was removed from the plugin_geoip code:
            This assert failure could be triggered in a debug build
              of the daemon by a carefully crafted request packet, but a
              normal cache would never generate such a packet intentionally.
            No known problems for non-debug builds (which should include all
              "normal" builds from debs/rpms, etc), but if you're running
              a debug build on the internet, it can be DoS'd with this.
          plugin_geoip "nets" data normalization was buggy when presented
            with certain odd sets of un-normalized networks which had
            overlapping and/or mergeable subnets in the data.  All known cases
            are now handled correctly. In the case of a complete conflict
            (exact same subnet/mask mapped to two different results explicitly),
            the choice between the two variants is arbitrary and a warning is
            issued (before, this resulted in load failure).
          Removed debugging and gdnsd_geoip_test text output length limitations
            on very long dclists.
          Fixed a testsuite bug which resulted in a false failure if
            the system's /usr/share/GeoIP/ contained database
            formats other Country, Region, and City.
