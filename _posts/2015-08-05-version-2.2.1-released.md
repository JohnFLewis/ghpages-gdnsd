    2.2.1 - 2015-08-05
      *** Bugs fixed:
        * extfile plugin - if the addresses/CNAMEs for a given extfile
          service_type are not listed in natural sort order in the configuration,
          extfile will update the wrong items (sorting bug).
        * rfc1035 zonefile reloading - Directory scanning (SIGUSR1, or automatic
          periodic scanning on a non-inotify system) would treat all zonefiles as
          changed and reload them all, without first filtering them on whether
          their stat() data had changed since the previous scan.  Not really a
          functional issue, but certainly wasteful and noisy.
        * HTTP monitoring - was not sending any User-Agent string, now sends
          "User-Agent: gdnsd-monitor"
