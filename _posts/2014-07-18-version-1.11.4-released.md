    1.11.4 - 2014-07-18
        Major bugfix: The SOA record returned in the auth section of
          negative responses (NXDOMAIN and NODATA) had an incorrect TTL.
            RFC 2308 says that auth servers should set the SOA record's
          own TTL to the minimum of the real SOA TTL and the SOA
          "minimum" field (aka ncache field), but gdnsd was simply using
          the real SOA TTL and assuming caches looked at the
          minimum/ncache field directly (which they do not).
            The fallout is that if you specified a minimum/ncache
          value of 3H but the TTL of the SOA record itself
          was 24H, your negative answers to caches would indicate
          that the answer should be cached for 24H.  Luckily
          many caches limit ncache durations (e.g. BIND9 defaults to
          a limit of 3H), mitigating the issue somewhat, but
          it's still a pretty big deal.
    
        Bugfix: plugin_geoip was not correctly runtime-reloading
          geoip databases from geoip_db_v4_overlay due to a simple
          code error, which is now fixed.
