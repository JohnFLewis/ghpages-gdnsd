    1.11.2 - 2014-02-27
        Bugfix: HTTP stats output network send code was horribly
          broken in theory, but the bugs were difficult to hit
          in practice.  Triggering required the combination of
          a large-enough set of monitored services and smallish
          TCP send buffers, such that the data wouldn't be
          completely sent by the first writev() call.  Was finally
          noticed by someone monitoring 50+ services on a certain
          type of VM instance (thanks YTS for the report!)
        Bugfix: Stats output buffer calculations made more-robust.
          They were too small in some very corner cases, but I
          don't believe anyone ever hit this bug; it was found
          via source analysis.
        Bugfix: plugin_simplefo now works correctly with no
          service_types specified (default http checks).  This
          has been broken for years.  Apparently nobody uses it
          this way, if at all.
        *** This is a good time to re-iterate that v2.0.0 is due
          sometime "soon".  2.x will have some substantial
          backwards-compatibility breaks with 1.x, especially for
          any 3rd party plugin.  Anything that currently gives a
          deprecation notice in 1.x will be removed/changed in 2.x
          for sure, so look out for those in your log output.  The
          branch is available as it progresses at:
