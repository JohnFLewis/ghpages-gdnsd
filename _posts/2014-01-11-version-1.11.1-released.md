    1.11.1 - 2014-02-11
        Bugfix for plugin_geoip's normalization of "nets" input data.
          This bug affected some forms of un-normalized "nets" inputs,
          resulting in incorrect responses (or assertfail in debug builds).
          The replacement code is much simpler and more reliable, but
          also slower.
        Build Bugfix: plugins' dependencies on libm were being met
          indirectly via libgdnsd's library deps in automake/libtool
          terms.  However, due to platform variances as to which
          math functions are inlined, combined with the "--as-needed"
          linker flag, sometimes libm was not linked for libgdnsd,
          which could result in plugins not finding math symbols.
          This has caused build problems on at least Ubuntu/i386 and
          Ubuntu/ppc64el.  The fix moved the libm deps to their
          proper places in the respective Makefile.am's.
        The official tarball download URLs are moving back to github
          at https://github.com/gdnsd/gdnsd/releases/ .  The old
          location will continue to host the tarballs that exist
          there for a while, so as not to disrupt automated things,
          and this bugfix release will also be published in both
          places just in case.
