    1.11.5 - 2014-09-10
        Bugfixes:
          Remove F_PURE from rfc1035 out-of-zone check
            This was causing out-of-zone data checks during
            the loading of rfc1035 zonefiles to be skipped
            sometimes, depending on compiler/optimizations.
          Change down_thresh min value from 1 to 2.
            The value "1" leads to buggy behavior, and was
            never intended to be possible in the state
            machine's design.
          Only use EPROTO if it's available.
            Build-time bugfix for OpenBSD support.
          Fix Linux version detection for initial 3.x kernels
            Runtime checks of the Linux kernel version
            for feature support were failing on 3.x.0 kernel
            versions which do not include the ".0" in the
            version string.
        Deprecations:
          extmon: add %%ITEM%%, deprecate %%IPADDR%%
          plugin_weighted: deprecate "cnames" stanza
            (both of these are to smooth out the 2.x transition)
